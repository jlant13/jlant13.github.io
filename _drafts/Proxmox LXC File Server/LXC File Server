            apt update && apt full-upgrade

        install cockpit
            apt install --no-install-recommends cockpit -y

        Allow root access to connect to webui, temporarily
            nano /etc/cockpit/disallowed-users

            # root          # find and comment out root user

        Open browser to [LXC_IP]:9090 
            login in using LXC credentials

    Shutdown LXC

    Create Mount Point
        Node > Shell 
            mkdir /data/media         # /data is my zfs pool 

        edit lxc config file

                    # /data/media is the directory created on host or in my case the zfs pool 
                    # /mnt/media is where the directory will be found on the LXC filesystem 

                # uid map: from uid 0 map 1005 uids (in the ct) to the range starting 100000 (on the host), so 0..1004 (ct) → 100000..101004 (host)
