Creating a Plex Server in Ubuntu LXC

    iGPU Verification
        Proxmox Node > Shell 
            lspci -v | grep -e VGA      
                # lists VGA compatible controllers
                # take note of the PCIe address, ex. 00:02.0

            lspci -v -s 00:02.0
                # lists more info about the device

    Plex LXC Installation
        Proxmox Node > Shell 
            Install Plex LXC using Ttecks install script.
                bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/ct/plex.sh)"

                Core Count:
                    4           # 2-4 is fine to start, if you need more you can allocate more later
                RAM:

                Select Storage: 
                    # I set mine to my SSD local-lvm 
                
                Wait for the script to finish, make sure not to close out of the shell window or terminal session. Once complete there will be a 'Plex should be reachable message'

    LXC Driver Verification
        In the same terminal, run the following command:
            ls -l /dev/dri
                # look for at least one 'renderD' entry

            If you don’t see the above, or see “No such file or directory”, then your Intel iGPU is not enabled properly. Please check your BIOS settings and make sure that Intel Integrated Graphics is enabled and IOMMU is disabled. Make sure the LXC container is turned off, then proceed with the following:

                Proxmox Node > Shell 
                    nano /etc/pve/lxc/[CONTAINER_ID].conf

                Add the following lines to the bottom of the config file.

                    lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 226:0 rwm
                    lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 226:128 rwm
                    lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 29:0 rwm
                    lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri dev/dri none bind,optional,create=dir
                    lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri/renderD128 dev/renderD128 none bind,optional,create=file

                Now start your container and run ls -l /dev/dri in your container.

    Create Mount Point 

        Shutdown LXC 

        Proxmox > Shell 
            edit lxc config file 
                nano /etc/pve/lxc/[CT_ID].conf 

                add the following lines to the bottom of the conf file
                    mp0: /data/media,mp=/mnt/media
                        # mp0 being the first configured mount point, increment by 1 for more mount points 
                        # /data/media is the directory created on host or in my case the zfs pool 
                        # /mnt/media is where the directory will be found on the LXC filesystem
                Save 
        
        Start Plex LXC
